# PORTFOLIO

HTML framework of the website was based on several semantic tags: nav, header, section, article, footer.
Using navigation we can choose any section and by click move to it by using properties scrollTop and function offset().top.
The arrow that appears in the bottom right corner enables you to quick return to the top of the page.
The website is responsive. 
When the page has 500px width (or less) the header changes to the mobile version. Then the navigation disappears and the burger appears, after clicking it the navigation appears again but in the full-page version.

Sections:
* 'About' includes some information about the author ot the website.
* In 'Skills' I presented the technologies I learn and on the basis of which I create my projects.
* 'Projects' contain four exemplary aplications running on JS, jQ and/or React.
* In 'Contact' we have icon-link to my GitHub with more projects. I also included an exemplary contact form that appears as a pop-up and a short CV.

In the project I used the jQuery library many times in order to show my skills in this technology.
